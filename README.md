# ClusterTyping
Type marginally faster if you have an n-key rollover keyboard by pressing clusters of keys simultaneously. The program will replace your scrambled mess with its corresponding word according to a translation file, *vocab.txt*. *vocab.txt* uses a self-explanatory format.

For example, if *vocab.txt* contains the line *reg ret: regret*, then hammer out the letters *r* *e* *g* simultaneously, then *r* *e* *t* simultaneously, producing something that looks like *egretr*, and press [space], and the program will replace *egretr* with *regret*.

If *vocab.txt* contains the line *yt: how many hours of my life have I spent on youtube?*, then typing *ty* and pressing [space] will output *how many hours of my life have I spent on youtube?*.
